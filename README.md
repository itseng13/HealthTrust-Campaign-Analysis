# HealthTrust-Campaign-Analysis
Founded in 2016, HealthTrust is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers across the United States. In 2019, they introduced a new suite of marketing campaign categories, covering topics such as wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Customers can choose from four different plans—Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum—each offering varied premiums and claim coverage rates.

With a new data team now in place and a strategic focus on optimizing the marketing budget for the year, HealthTrust is committed to enhancing its understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and their impact on signups and subsequent patient claims. As a data analyst at HealthTrust, this project is dedicated to developing interactive visualizations and an interactive dashboard that enable the marketing team to independently access insights and produce regular reports.
